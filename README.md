This site is used as a virtual whiteboard and journal. It gives all team members (manual) write access to the DB.

During the race, the scout car team can add entries to the database via this site for strategy decisions. 
But also any other team member can add any messages. This can be comments like “seen a kangaroo!” or tags like “drove over pothole” or “passed a road train” (or “nice view”, hopefully this: “overtook Innoptus”) also additional data can be captured like “roadtemperature: 50”. 
By default the current location is sent along with the message.

Additionally there is a listener script, it takes these messages and prints them to console. It serves as a template. The connection to the DB will be based on the listener.
